# ðŸŽ“ Certificates

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

I am proud to showcase two significant certifications that reflect my commitment to 
continuous learning and professional development in web design and programming. 
The first is a Web Design Certificate from Coursera, where I gained comprehensive knowledge about creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites. 
The second certificate is in HTML & CSS from F8, which provided me with a solid foundation in web development, 
focusing on structuring and styling web pages effectively. 
These certifications have equipped me with the essential skills to build modern and responsive web applications.

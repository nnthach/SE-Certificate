# 🎓 Certificates

## 🌟 Introduction

I am proud to showcase two significant certifications that reflect my commitment to continuous learning and professional development in web design and programming. The first is a Web Design Certificate from Coursera, where I gained comprehensive knowledge about creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites. The second certificate is in HTML & CSS from F8, led by Nguyen Ngoc Thach, which provided me with a solid foundation in web development, focusing on structuring and styling web pages effectively. These certifications have equipped me with the essential skills to build modern and responsive web applications.
